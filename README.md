# Bootstrap 4 with CDN Boilerplate

Ever been trying to start with a bootstrap template? 

This is normally not an issue but I found it tedious with using `!` then add all CSS  with font-awesome and jquery etc.

This extension will solve the issue for you with a simple `!bcdn` + `TAB` and your up and running with a full template
